"# blockchain-ethereum-smart-contracts-solidity" 

Built a blockchain app using Ethereum smart contracts 

Created a todo app with Ethereum smart contracts using the Solidity programming language. 

Wrote tests, deployed to the blockchain, and created a client-side application






client-side application talks directly to the blockchain

On the blockchain, there are code written with Ethereum smart contracts that contains all the business logic for the todo list


All the to do items will be stored on the blockchain itself


## What is blockchain?

peer-to-peer network of nodes\
distributed network\
All the nodes on the network participate in running the network, \
they all contain a copy of the code on the blockchain and all of the data on the blockchain


ALl the data on the blockchain is contained in bundles of records called blocks, which are chained together to make the blockchain\
All the node on the network also participate in ensuring that the data/public ledger is secure and unchangeable\
This makes the blockchain powerful

## Smart contracts
All the code on the blockchain is contained in smart contracts

Smart contracts are basically just the **programs** that run on the blockchain, and they are going to be the building blocks of blockchain application.


We write a smart contract that will contain all the tasks in the todo list, and allow us to add new ones and complete them

Written in **solidity**



All the code in the smart contract is **immutable**, unchangeable


Whenever you deploy to the blockchain, we won't be able to update that code \
This is what blockchain so secure

Whenever we put code on the blockchain, we know we can trust it \
"Trustless for a reason"


Like **Microservices** on the web




Truffle framework 

truffle is a suite of tools that allows us to develop smart contract, write test, deploy smart contract to the blockchain, gives development console, and allow us to develop client side application inside of our project.


ganache


MetaMask allows to connect to the blockchain with our personal account, and actually interact with the smart contract we developed.



Ethereum blockchain is a network, we need special browser extension in order to connect to that network.







### List tasks
1. List tasks in the smart contract
2. List tasks in the console
3. List tasks in the client side application
4. List tasks in the test
